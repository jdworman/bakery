I created a fullstack bakery that displays cookies, cakes, muffins, cupcakes, crumb cakes, and pastries.  I created each category with nine items for each item.  I used an API to link my events page.

# Resources
- I got all my cake images from [Noe Valley Bakery](https://noevalleybakery.com/)
- I also use the above link to right a lot of my dialogue and changed a little bit of it to feel like a real bakery.
- I got all my other bakery items from [Harvest Bakery](http://harvestbakery.com/)
- I got my API from [Event Brite](eventbrite.com)
- Also, I got my background image from a google search.
