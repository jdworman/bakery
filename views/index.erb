We make all our recipes from scratch in our kitchen.  We want our customers to be as close to the action as possiable.</h2>

                        <h3 class="bucket-title">Grid is great</h3>
                        <p>CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout tool. It is great for laying out content in a grid, and for laying out content in two dimensions.</p>

                </li>

                        <h3 class="bucket-title">Flex is great too</h3>
                        <p>That said, Grid is not always the right option for layouts. If for example you need to lay out a series of identical boxes like those you see here, Flex may be a better option.</p>

                <h2 class="content-title">Subgrid would be nice here</h2>
                <p>The solution provided here is limited by the lack of support for subgrids. If subgrids were available, the solution would be more refined. In lieu of subgrid, the solution applies a grid to each full-bleed section within the layout using a common class <code>.grid</code> and creates the full-bleed/centered effect that way.<p>

            <h2 class="content-title">Grid lets you do unusual things</h2>
            <p>Creating this layout, where two items share the total available viewport width evenly alongside full-width and centered content, is suprisingly complex if you don't have CSS Grid available.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="twin">
            <h2 class="content-title">Grid requires a rethink</h2>
            <p>Seeing this layout you may still think it's better to just use old methods with auto-margins and max-widths. And you <em>can</em>, but looking at the CSS you'll see the Grid approach is both cleaner and easier to understand.</p>
