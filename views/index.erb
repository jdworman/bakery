                   <h2>When we opened our doors in 1984, we set out to be the best bakery in New York City.  We had a misson: to create the best cookies, cakes, and muiffins below 125 Street.  We make all our recipes from scratch in our kitchen.  We want our customers to be as close to the action as possiable.</h2>

                        <h3 class="bucket-title">Grid is great</h3>
                        <p>CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout tool. It is great for laying out content in a grid, and for laying out content in two dimensions.</p>

                </li>

                        <h3 class="bucket-title">Flex is great too</h3>
                        <p>That said, Grid is not always the right option for layouts. If for example you need to lay out a series of identical boxes like those you see here, Flex may be a better option.</p>

                <h2 class="content-title">Subgrid would be nice here</h2>
                <p>The solution provided here is limited by the lack of support for subgrids. If subgrids were available, the solution would be more refined. In lieu of subgrid, the solution applies a grid to each full-bleed section within the layout using a common class <code>.grid</code> and creates the full-bleed/centered effect that way.<p>

            <h2 class="content-title">Grid lets you do unusual things</h2>
            <p>Creating this layout, where two items share the total available viewport width evenly alongside full-width and centered content, is suprisingly complex if you don't have CSS Grid available.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="twin">
            <h2 class="content-title">Grid requires a rethink</h2>
            <p>Seeing this layout you may still think it's better to just use old methods with auto-margins and max-widths. And you <em>can</em>, but looking at the CSS you'll see the Grid approach is both cleaner and easier to understand.</p>
